# CustomSwipeListView

CustomSwipeListView provides a simple way to Swipe ListView item From right to left and Left to right.

Support for Android 4.0 and up. It might work on lower API versions, but I haven't tested it and I don't intend to make any effort in that direction.

Feel free to fork or issue pull requests on github.
